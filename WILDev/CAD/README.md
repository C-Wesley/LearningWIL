# CAD Files

This folder contains Parasolid (`.x_t`) and STEP (`.step`) files, along with a small set of rudimentary drawings. The drawings are not intended to fully recreate the models from scratch, but they do provide key dimensions and design intent.

The Parasolid files can be uploaded directly into OnShape for inspection or modification; however, they do not include the full feature history of the original models. The original OnShape documents can be shared upon request.

The STEP files are fully self-contained and can be sliced and 3D printed as-is.
