# Thruster Controls
We are using two Blue Robotics T200 thrusters and their Basic ESCs.

Objectives:
-Understand PWM Control of T200's
-Use the Serial Monitor to test different speeds

The T200 thrusters use a three phase brushless motor.
You can think of each phase as a separate coil that is wraped around a stator. 
These coils are energized following a pattern to make the rotor spin. See diagram below.
